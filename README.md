# Personalized-Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Collaborative-Filtering

This project focuses on developing a movie recommendation system using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and historical ratings. The system is developed in R using the recommenderlab package, which allows for the creation of both user-based and item-based recommendation models.

# Dataset Overview

The MovieLens dataset used in this project contains approximately 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1664 movies, collected over a period of seven months via the MovieLens website.

# Key Features

Data Exploration: Initial analysis of user-movie interactions and data preprocessing including normalization of ratings.

User-Based Recommender System: Implementation of a user-based collaborative filtering model (UBCF) to recommend movies based on similar user preferences.

Item-Based Recommender System: Development of an item-based collaborative filtering model (IBCF) to suggest movies based on similarities between items.

Evaluation and Comparison: Comparative analysis of both recommender systems to assess their effectiveness in providing relevant and diverse movie recommendations.

# Requirements: "recommenderlab" R package needs to be installed
